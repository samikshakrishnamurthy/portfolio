    So far, I see that both Python and Scratch can animate objects. Both use loops and functions, as well as variables. However, Scratch is clearly a beginner's introduction to code, while Python is much more advanced. I learned a lot by debugging my program today. Though it was frustrating at first, it was very satisfying to get a complete product at the end of it all. <p>

    <p> This is our circuit that we made that makes a lightbulb light up when a button is pressed. I learned a lot about breadboards and the board of education shield today. We ran into problems when trying to get two lightbulbs to lightbulbs at once. </p>
   <p> Today, we made a robot do an LED light show. I learned a lot about loops and C++ in general, which I was really confused about yesterday. I also learned a lot about the Arduino program, and uploading projects. Overall, I had fun, though it was definitely challending at first. </p>

<p> Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both work with robots to make life easier for us, and to make new innovations that help us expand our worldview. Also, both of their robots are cool. Our team worked pretty well on the lightshow, but I feel like it would have been nice if we had started out knowing what we were doing. The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch are integers, loops, setups, and making sure to verify and upload. </p>

      <p> I learned about how to wire a piezo, and how all the wires eventually connect to a battery pack at the bottom, which is the main source of the power. We didn't have much of a robot dance, but the fact that it made a hexagon was pretty cool. The kind of outputs that Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need for their robots are sensors, and also a lot of human interaction, that makes a robot respond to a command in a certain way. </p>

<p> I learned a lot today about programming a robot to sense its surroundings using different tools. Though I didn't get a working finished project, I had some fun testing out different ways to get the robot to move. Overall, I am happy to be done with the robotics unit, but I had some fun with the song. </p>

<p> A list is a bunch of items that can be stored in Python. It's useful to store multiple items, and very easy to manipulate. I think all the groups that I worked with worked well together, and I had fun in all my groups. </p>

<p> One thing I learned about the internet was that servers connect us to webpages, and are placed all around the world. They can be rented hourly, and a really big server vendor is Amazon Web Services. I think that LaTeX is a markup language, because it allows people to format documents, which is a form of styling. </p>
<p> 7/24/17 </p>
<p> There’s a lot of information about me on the internet, including the Prezis I’ve made. That information is available, because I made a public account with my real name. A programmer can do a lot to program the privacy of their users, including setting strict conditions for a password. Latanya Sweeney and Shafi Goldwasser protect people’s privacy by inventing new and innovative technologies that prevent black hat hackers from accessing private information, like zero-knowledge proofs. </p>
<p> Final Project: </p>
<p> I really liked working on my portfolio/webpage this summer, and I would like to build a website for my final project as well. I would like to learn a little more about accessibility for users with different disabilities, and add those functions to my website. </p>
<p> 7/26/17: </p>
<p> Python dictionaries are useful to use as reference values, unlike lists. Honestly, I didn't love data science, but the projects that can be created with it were interesting. I think the most interesting thing about algorithms is how if one simple concept is defined in a part of the code, it can be used throughout to solve complicated problems. Algorithms can help us on a daily basis with things like Google Maps, and calculating distance, or telling us where the nearest restaurant is. </p>
<p> 7/27/17: </p>
<p> Objects made this program way harder, in my opinion, because I still don't have a full grasp of what exacly object oriented programming is used for. I am proud that I was able to create my project today, and was able to expand my classes towards the very end, because I didn't really understand much when I started out. </p>
<p> 7/28/7: </p>
<p> What I'm most proud of figuring out today is how to use classes and objects in my code. What I'm most excited about for final projects is designing the UI and UX of the website, which I really enjoy doing. </p>
<p> 8/1/17: </p>
<p> Our team is divided into two- two on the webpage, and two on the chatbot. We chose this to make everything more efficient. I am responsible for designing the webpage, and I am completing those tasks with the help of Divya and using the Kanban Board. </p>
<p> 8/2/17: </p>
<p> The greatest challenge is probably the creator bios, which is just really difficult to align with the pictures. I think I have to read up more on alignment and floating, as well as creating boxes to help me do this. </p>
          <p> 8/3/17: </p>
          <p> We have our MVP already, which is really good in terms of time and efficiency. I don't really have any problems with the way we're working. I've mainly had bugs with my picture overlay, and I fixed it by getting help and finding alternate solutions. </p>
          <p> 8/4/17: </p>
          <p> I am on track for my personal goals. I don't really have any adjustments or updates. </p>
          <p> 8/7/17: </p>
          <p> Our project will help people going through a hard time. Our chatbot still has a lot of bugs, which we continue to work on. </p>
