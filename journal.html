    So far, I see that both Python and Scratch can animate objects. Both use loops and functions, as well as variables. However, Scratch is clearly a beginner's introduction to code, while Python is much more advanced. I learned a lot by debugging my program today. Though it was frustrating at first, it was very satisfying to get a complete product at the end of it all. <p>

    <p> This is our circuit that we made that makes a lightbulb light up when a button is pressed. I learned a lot about breadboards and the board of education shield today. We ran into problems when trying to get two lightbulbs to lightbulbs at once. </p>
   <p> Today, we made a robot do an LED light show. I learned a lot about loops and C++ in general, which I was really confused about yesterday. I also learned a lot about the Arduino program, and uploading projects. Overall, I had fun, though it was definitely challending at first. </p>

<p> Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both work with robots to make life easier for us, and to make new innovations that help us expand our worldview. Also, both of their robots are cool. Our team worked pretty well on the lightshow, but I feel like it would have been nice if we had started out knowing what we were doing. The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch are integers, loops, setups, and making sure to verify and upload. </p>

      <p> I learned about how to wire a piezo, and how all the wires eventually connect to a battery pack at the bottom, which is the main source of the power. We didn't have much of a robot dance, but the fact that it made a hexagon was pretty cool. The kind of outputs that Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard need for their robots are sensors, and also a lot of human interaction, that makes a robot respond to a command in a certain way. </p>

<p> I learned a lot today about programming a robot to sense its surroundings using different tools. Though I didn't get a working finished project, I had some fun testing out different ways to get the robot to move. Overall, I am happy to be done with the robotics unit, but I had some fun with the song. </p>

<p> A list is a bunch of items that can be stored in Python. It's useful to store multiple items, and very easy to manipulate. I think all the groups that I worked with worked well together, and I had fun in all my groups. </p>
