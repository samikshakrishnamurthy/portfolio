    So far, I see that both Python and Scratch can animate objects. Both use loops and functions, as well as variables. However, Scratch is clearly a beginner's introduction to code, while Python is much more advanced. I learned a lot by debugging my program today. Though it was frustrating at first, it was very satisfying to get a complete product at the end of it all. <p>

    <p> This is our circuit that we made that makes a lightbulb light up when a button is pressed. I learned a lot about breadboards and the board of education shield today. We ran into problems when trying to get two lightbulbs to lightbulbs at once. </p>
